# Signature-Recognition
Signature Recognition using **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** and **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** in c++ using opencv library and qt for GUI. 

# Project is divided in 3 parts- 
#1. Preprocessing on training singature samples.
#2. Feature Extraction using HOG descriptor. 
#3. Classification using SVM.
#4. Matching of test signature with training sample images.
